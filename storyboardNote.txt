storyboard

When from controller A to controller B,
prepareForSegue in A is called before loadView in controller B

embed controller in another navigation controller
    Editor -> Embed in -> Navigation Controller 
    
pass data between controller

    if controller A push controller B, 
    A's following method will be called when A push B
        - (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender;
    
    pass data to B ex:
        - (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender
        {
            WebViewController *controller = (WebViewController*)[segue destinationViewController];
            controller.urlStr = @"http://www.apple.com";
        }



segue identifier
    we can set segue identifier and check segue identifier in following method
        - (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender

    segue identifier can be the same for different view controller
    
show another view controller at startup ( not initial view controller)
    in initial view controller's viewDidLoad, show another view controller
    
    
dynamic cell can not use segua to connect in storyboard

awakeFromNib is called before viewDidLoad
