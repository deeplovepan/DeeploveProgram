instruments can detect retain cycle

__bridge_transfer:  
    from CF to NSString
    “Hey ARC, this CFStringRef object is now an NSString object and we want you to dispose of it, so that we don’t have to call CFRelease() on it ourselves.”
    ex:
        NSString *newUUID = (__bridge_transfer NSString*)CFUUIDCreateString(nil, uuidObj);
        
        
__bridge_retained:
    from NSString to CF
     use __bridge_retained to give the object to Core Foundation so that ARC is no longer responsible for releasing it.
