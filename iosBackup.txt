ios backup

Backups are completely managed by iTunes and stored per device, so they cannot be used to transfer information between the same app on 
different devices. More precisely, iTunes stores a single backup for each different iOS device you sync. So if you have an iPad and an iPhone, 
iTunes will have one backup for the iPad and one backup for the iPhone.
